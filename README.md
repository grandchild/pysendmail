## Send Mail from the Commandline, with Python

```shell
$ cd pysendmail
$ ‚ê£export MAIL_PASSWORD=s3cr3t  # A leading space might prevent your password
                                # from appearing in your terminal history.
                                # (Often the case, but depends on your setup.)

# Now send an email:

$ ./sendmail.py --user me@example.com --server smtp.example.com --to you@example.org \
    --subject test --content "Hi there!"

# or, shorter:

$ ./sendmail.py -u me@example.com -m smtp.example.com -t you@example.org \
    -s test -c "Hi there!"
```
